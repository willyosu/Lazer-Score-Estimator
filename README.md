# Lazer-Score-Estimator
A score estimator for lazer's standardized and classic scoring written in Python.
With spinner spin and spinner bonus not able to be accounted for this is only a close estimation of how lazer calculates score. Last updated February 19, 2022, so this is out of date if scoring has changed since then.
